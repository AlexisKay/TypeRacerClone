If they say, who cares if one more light goes out in a sky of a million stars? It flickers, flickers. Who cares when someone's time runs out if a moment is all we are. We're quicker, quicker. Who cares if one more light goes out? Well, I do. — One More Light (song) by Linkin Park 
Always look on the bright side of life. Always look on the light side of life. If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten, and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing. When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly chumps; just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing. — Monty Python's Life of Brian (movie) by Terry Jones 
Everyone thinks they are above average, which is statistically impossible. —from Inside The Mind of an Introvert, a book by Oliver Markus Malloy
Science isn't about "why." It's about "why not." Why is so much of our science dangerous? Why not marry safe science if you love it so much. In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you on the butt on the way out? Because you are fired!  —from Portal 2, a game by Valve Corporation
Oh, you think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding! —from The Dark Knight Rises, a movie by Christopher Nolan

Letters are symbols. They are building blocks of words which form our languages. Languages help us communicate. Even with complicated languages used by intelligent people, misunderstanding is a common occurrence. We write things down sometimes - letters, words - hoping they will serve us and those with whom we wish to communicate. Letters and words, calling out for understanding. —from Twin Peaks, a other by David Lynch and Mark Frost
Now the scandal and the light are to be distributed differently; it is the conviction itself that marks the offender with the unequivocally negative sign: the publicity has shifted to the trial, and to the sentence. —from Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, a book by Michel Foucault
Words have the power to both destroy and heal. When words are both true and kind, they can change our world. —from Civilization IV, a game by Sid Meier
Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin.  —from SpongeBob SquarePants, a other by Stephen Hillenburg
I hate this place, this zoo, this prison, this reality, whatever you want to call it. I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink, and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it. —from The Matrix, a movie by Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski
I could kill you. Snap my fingers, easiest thing in the world. From here on, I want you to know that the only reason you're alive is because I allowed it. —from Supernatural, another by Eric Kripke
People move because of the wear and tear of anxiety. Because of the gnawing feeling that no matter how hard they work their efforts will yield nothing, that what they build up in one year will be torn down in one day by others. Because of the impression that the future is blocked up, that they might do all right but not their children. Because of the feeling that nothing will change, that happiness and prosperity are possible only somewhere else. —from Life of Pi, a book by Yann Martel
